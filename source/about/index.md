I solve business problems by building software and help organisations to get better at building software.

I am one of the founders of [Domain Driven Design Belgium](http://domaindriven.be/).

- Proficient in C#, JavaScript, lover of Erlang, Elixir and more recently Haskell.
- I love DDD, CQRS and tackling legacy software.

> It was a lot of fun to work with Tom during my first European IDDDTour.com Workshops. Tom was very helpful in drawing together members of the DDD community in Belgium, and he also gave a couple of insightful presentations at the IDDD Workshop in Belgium. With Tom's varied experience I look forward to collaborating on projects in the future.

> Tom assisted Gateway in raising the maturity of the development teams. Besides improving the solutions for source control, test automation and software development management; he also 'Chinese volunteered' to act as interim team lead during times of extreme workload or absenses. No-nonsense, what you see is what you get, no hidden agendas, easy going but determined. The way I like coworkers best. Keen to work again someday in the future, Tom

He works very good together with both clients as colleagues, and provides an excellent service. He has an extensive technical knowledge, and manages to think out-of-the-box, and provides great solutions within time and budget and with excellent quality. I would be pleased to be able to work with Tom again in the future
