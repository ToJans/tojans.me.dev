Tom Janssens is an independent freelance ICT consultant that has been "into computers" ever since the age of 7. Typing source code from a book evolved into exploring the limits of coding in procedural, assembly, object-oriented and functional languages.

As he matured in software coding, he started focusing on the problems surrounding software development, and learned that software development is usually about people and interactions first, and about technology second.

Due to his diverse track record he gained insights in a lot of aspects of the software development process.

Currently his main focus is on strategic ICT advice, lean product/project development and improving the software development process and architecture. He avoids ivory-tower-approaches by applying and verifying the applicability of the latest tech buzz in software experiments.
