<h3>Finally !!</h3>
<p>It has been a while since I blogged about my <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Project-Startup10-Learning-to-build-your-own-business.aspx">project #startup10</a>, and there has been a reason for that... In the past months I have been talking quite a lot with a former colleague of mine, who co-founded a start-up, but on a whole different scale/level as <a href="http://blommekes.be/" target="_blank">my 2 utterly</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://dampen.be/" target="_blank">simple experiments</a>.</p>
<p>After having to keep my mouth shut for over a month - which was, as for those of you who know me, quite hard -, I am finally allowed to tell the world I am joining the start-up&nbsp;<a href="http://paycento.com/" target="_blank">www.paycento.com</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<h3>Paycento ? WHUT ? What's that ?</h3>
<p>As it has been covered by international press, I will not try to write up my own version of the story, so I will refer you to some of the online press coverage:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2012/04/02/technology/02reuters-paycento-internet.html?_r=2&amp;ref=technology" target="_blank">New York Times - "Web Surfers to Pay Online Using Facebook, Twitter"</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2012/04/02/technology/02reuters-paycento-internet.html?_r=2&amp;ref=technology" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal - "Belgian Company Trials Facebook, Twitter-Based Payment System"</a></li>
<li><a href="http://geeko.lesoir.be/2012/03/26/exclusif-paycento-une-startup-belge-lance-le-paiement-par-facebook/" target="_blank">Le Soir - "Exclusif : une startup belge lance le paiement par Facebook"</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tweakers.net/nieuws/81102/belgische-start-up-laat-gebruikers-betalen-via-twitter-of-facebook.html" target="_blank">Tweakers.Net - "Belgische startup laat gebruikers betalen via Twitter of Facebook&lrm;"</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=nl&amp;gl=be&amp;tbm=nws&amp;q=paycento&amp;oq=paycento" target="_blank">And so much more...</a></li>
</ul>
<div><br /></div>
<div>As you can see Paycento got a lot of global coverage, and as you might notice, we received some nice and utterly positive feedback...</div>

<h3><br /></h3>
<h3>What is your role there ?</h3>
<p>Simply put: all things software that are not front-end.&nbsp;Things will shape up as we progress, but as&nbsp;Paycento believes in the value of sharing knowledge, you can expect at least some blog posts about our experiences and findings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am aware that this assignment will be a huge challenge, but I am looking forward to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What does that imply for your project #Startup10 ?</h3>
<p>Since about a month ago project #startup10 has been put on temporary hold. I will still deliver the promised blog posts, but new startups will have to wait until a later/undetermined date. We are looking forward to sharing the Paycento experience with you !</p>
<p>Signing off,</p>
