When I read [this blog post](http://dupdob.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/the-secret-for-100-test-coverage-remove-code) about how and why one should achieve 100% code coverage on his code, I was flabbergasted, and when I noticed Bart's reply, I decided to check:

### The subject 

Here is the gist of [the article](http://dupdob.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/the-secret-for-100-test-coverage-remove-code):

> For me, there is no question **100% coverage is** the **only** worthy **objective, do not settle for less**.

> There is one simple golden rule: to reach and maintain 100% coverage, you do not need to add tests, you have to **remove not covered lines!**
>
> This is important, so let me restate that: a line of code that is not covered is **not maintainable, must be seen as not working and must be removed!**

### Trolling?

In my personal opinion, this is wrong on so many levels so I decided to ask if he was trolling.... He said he was not, so this was my reply:

> Well, IRL working code providing business value beats coverage/good design by miles... Also, there is a lot of added business value in legacy code, so don't delete it, but refactor it (see fowler's book).
>
> Another thing people sometimes do is throw away test code, as it is holding them back (in fact, lots of tests are considered legacy), so I wouldn't approach this black & white.
>
>While I love good, well written code (preferably developed with BDD or similar), that is not always the case. Just deleting it would be ...
>
>To quote someone replying on twitter: "rm -rf /"; 100% coverage done, now let's grab a beer...

This was the tweet I was referring to, BTW:

### The reply

>Thanks for your feedback. Working software over anything else, yes :-), but working software without adequate automated tests getting legacy by the minute..
>
> Definitely, I did not have legacy code in mind, so I will edit the post to clarify that.
Adding test before refactoring is a good approach, but 100 % coverage is not only overkill, but counterproductive.

> When tests are thrown away, someone has failed: either the test was not relevant (probably too close to the implementation) or the maintainer was lazy...

Which might sound reasonable, however, there are some caveats IMO:

### My reply

>There's different concepts of testing; TDD usually tests the implementation, not the behavior AFAIK... So when you change your implementation, you need to change your tests. BDD removes some of those issues.
>
>Using TDD for problem exploration is usually a major PITA; Peter Norvig's Sudoku [1] is a commonly known example...
>
>When you think about the problem first, manage to understand it and keep the solution simple, a few integration tests are all you need...
>
>Test-driven design can help you to create an implementation, not to find a solution. Proper modelling is necessary and way too often people forget that.
>
>Also, if you want to verify whether your code works: 100% test coverage actually proves nothing; take the simple example if forgetting to check for a division by zero somewhere.
>
>If you really want to verify how good your solution matches the problem space, I would suggest you to use property based testing; that will discover way more edge- and side-cases then you could ever imagine....

### In conclusion

Don't get me wrong; I love Behaviour-Driven development, and even use some TDD from time to time, but if the problem is not complicated I just verify whether my solution model covers my problem space, using integration-like tests.

If something really needs to be thoroughly tested, I would suggest to try property-based testing; at least that will show you where the problems in your solution space are.
