title: ! 'Continuous thinking: Essential business books shortlist: 3 business books
  everyone should have read'
---

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I like to read books, lots of them. Some I read only once (very fast, usually in a few hours, to get the main picture), and the good ones I read over and over again, or at a slower pace.</p>
<p>In case of non-fiction, I either read books about physics, economics or business methodologies.</p>
<p>While I read a lot of books, and some books gradually bring me a bit closer to the essential knowledge on a business level, I finally think I have a shortlist of 3 essential books one should read in order to acquire the basics.</p>
<p>I am not saying that this list is the only one possible, but it should give you enough universal business knowledge to get started. For every single book I mention, there will probably be umphteen alternatives providing similar content.</p>
<p>The list does not cover any specific techniques or methodologies, just universal approaches.</p>
<p>If you do have any suggestions or alternatives, do not hesitate to let me know.</p>
<p>(FYI I usually read the Dutch version, but I post the links to the original ones)</p>

<h3>1. "Skills for new managers" - McGraw-Hill</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Skills-New-Managers-Morey-Stettner/dp/0071356185" target="_blank">(link on amazon)</a></p>
<p><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2010%2f12%2fman_with_Book.jpg" alt="Looks like he could use some skills" /></p>
<p>I know the title says "managers", but in my opinion this book can be used as a guidance for business in general.</p>
<p>This is the first on my list for a very good reason: it is packed with essential knowledge and touches the most important aspects of working in a company/dealing with collegues:</p>
<ul>
<li>What makes a manager succesful ?</li>
<li>Management myths - things you should avoid</li>
<li>How to give a good first impression</li>
<li>How to manage by listening</li>
<li>How to talk like a manager</li>
<li>How to motivate</li>
<li>How to criticize</li>
<li>How to sanctionize</li>
<li>How to be efficient/time management</li>
<li>How to delegate</li>
<li>How to handle your boss</li>
<li>How to build a network</li>
</ul>
<p>It is written in a very down to earth style, and the book is full of examples and pragmatic guidelines. In my opinion one can apply these tips in a much broader context then just being a manager.</p>
<p>I reread this every few years, since it brings you back to the most essential things one should do.</p>

<h3>"How to Connect in Business in 90 Seconds or Less" - Nicholas Boothman</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Connect-Business-Seconds-Less/dp/0761125957/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293709920&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">(Link on amazon)</a></p>
<p><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2010%2f12%2fconnect.jpg" alt="One can never have enough connections" /></p>
<p>Since building a network and interacting with people is in my opinion one of the most important aspects in business, this needs a little special attention.</p>
<p>This book offers a very entertaining review of techniques one should apply in order to extend your business network and talk to customers/personel/bosses in general. It offers a very down-to-earth approach on how to improve your communication skills.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can not recall who I lended this book to the last time (I lended it to numerous people), so if the person who has it reads this, please give it back, since I would like to read it again to refresh my memory.</p>

<h3>"The Management Myth: Debunking Modern Business Philosophy" - Matthew Stewart</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Management-Myth-Debunking-Business-Philosophy/dp/0393338525/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1293710453&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">(Link on amazon)</a></p>
<p><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2010%2f12%2fmyth.jpg" alt="&quot;The big giant head&quot; from &quot;Third rock under the sun&quot; ?" /></p>
<p>While I read numerous books on methodologies and techniques on how to do business, this book points out what it is all about: techniques and methodolgies are there to help you, not to worship them.</p>
<p>I just recently (fast-) read this book a few days ago (in about 6 hours or so, so not very thoroughly), and while reading it, I was thinking "Now my list of essential business books is complete, I need to write a blog post on this".</p>
<p>I still have to read it a few times or take the time to read it through in a slower pace, but the key point here is that this book points out the major flaws in preferring methodologies over common sense.</p>
<p>Every time I read a new book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Companies-Leap-Others/dp/0066620996/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293711209&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">"Good to great" - Jim Collins</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/hohe-Kunst-%C3%9Cberzeugung-Christian-Altmann/dp/347881216X/ref=sr_1_11?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293711268&amp;sr=1-11" target="_blank">"Die hohe Kunst der &Uuml;berzeuging" - Hans Christian Altmann</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/80-20-Principle-Secret-Achieving/dp/0385491743/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293711338&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">"The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less" - Richard Koch</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307353133/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293711369&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">"The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich" - Timothy Ferris</a>, ...) I am really thinking this is the next big thing. This book is there to remind me to be a little bit more suspicious on the next <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_bullet" target="_blank">silver bullet</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/image.axd?picture=2010%2f12%2fwin.jpg" alt="I'm not there yet, but I am making progress ;-)" /></p>
<p>There you have it, this is my shortlist. The books on the list offer you a very broad amount of universal tips, techniques and methodologies one can use in business. The first one is there to give you a general idea, the second one specializes in a very important aspect of doing business/management, and finally the last one reminds you of the fact that one has to be a little bit conservative when reading in on "The next big thing&trade;".</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed the post, and if you think the list can be improved (taking into consideration you can only have 3 books), please leave your suggestions in the comments !!</p><div style="text-align:right"><a class="addthis_button" href="http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"><img src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif" width="125" height="16" alt="Bookmark and Share" style="border:0"/></a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pub=xa-4aec37702e3161d4"></script></div>
