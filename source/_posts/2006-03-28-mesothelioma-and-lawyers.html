<p>Since I am not a medically trained&nbsp;, I have absolutely no clue what this mesothelioma has to do with lawyers.<br /> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelioma">A quick look at wikipedia </a>gave me a clue :</p>
<p><strong>Mesothelioma</strong> is an uncommon form of <a title="Cancer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer">cancer</a>, usually associated with previous exposure to <a title="Asbestos" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos">asbestos</a>.</p>
<p>Given the huge claims one can make if someone gets cancer from living/working/spending time in a certain place, laywers seem to be smelling big money...</p>
<p>That might actually explain why they are providing so much funds for each click they get on their ads.</p>
<p>While lawyers allready have a bad reputation, this list is actually giving me some kind of proof to that some people being a lawyer are actually just in it for the money.</p>
<p>Here in Belgium we have a professional comite of laywers who would probably suspend their lawyership for a long time, since the people placing those adds aren't respecting the code; lawyers here have a certain status, and they are obliged to act to their status.</p>
<p>To me it seems that there are no limits anymore...
