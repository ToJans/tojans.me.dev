<p>
I am currently&nbsp;<strong>very very </strong>&nbsp;busy (15h+ a day) developing several projects, including Aestethics+ and Fact+.
</p>
<p>
Since it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve posted any updates, I decided to make an effort today (although it&#39;s currently 1.00 AM already).
</p>
<p>
Aestethics+ is a program written especially for plastic surgery clinics to manage their patients, an it looks like this (Click on the screen shot for a bigger version) :

<p>
It has been developed in cooperation with a team of several plastic surgeons from a new plastic surgery clinic, so it is actually modeled according to the need of the surgeons.<br />
The main&nbsp;advantages of this program are :<br />
- Simplicity : the user interface has been re-engineered several times following the wishes of our team. Seeing it = using it, almost no training needed.<br />
-&nbsp;Speed : a&nbsp;surgeon starts the application, sees it&#39;s own calender, and can click through on the appointments in order to see all of the patients data.<br />
- Central patient repository : all the patient info is available&nbsp;on a single screen : an overview / medical history / (previous) treatments / calendar - appointments / Pictures or other files / Sent letters / Payments<br />
-&nbsp;Schedules of other surgeons/operating rooms.<br />
- Possibility to create letter templates<br />
- Calendar drag-n-drop (like outlook)<br />
- Many more ....
</p>
<p>
I must say it &#39;s close to being implemented. (Current supported languages&nbsp;only include Dutch, but other languages are on their way) 
</p>
<p>
Potential distributors please contact me...

<p>
Fact+ is a ticketing/point-of-sale/invoicing/stock management system, and will be initially distributed in Belgium by our new partner, named Sofliecom. It will be offered as a complete point-of-sale system, including hardware. Pricing on this package is set to be very competitive : this system offers all the things named above,&nbsp;this with a comparable price like those of a regular cash register.<br />
Since the eye-candy on this application still needs a lot of work, I will not post any screen shots at this moment.

Now I&#39;m off to bed :-)

Good Night !!!
