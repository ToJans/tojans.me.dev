This is the follow-up to [my previous post](http://tojans.me/blog/2014/02/24/trolling-the-100-percent-tdd-coverage-approach-or-not/).

I wrote an example - obviously badly written on purpose - by which I prove why 100% code coverage is useless.

While these tests cover 100%, they miss a test case that I added in the comments on the bottom.
