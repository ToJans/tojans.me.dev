After chatting with a lot of friends yesterday, I realized: February will be awesome. Here's why:

![YOU are all awesome for helping me out!!](http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2012/06/unclesam.jpg)

- I get to finish the [Erlang FoundationDB driver](https://github.com/happypancake/fdb-erlang).
- I have a friend with [a well established email marketing business](http://www.mymailmarket.be/) that is hiring me (again) for a couple of weeks to fix some really challenging issues in .Net.
- I have another client is hiring me this month. When he hires me, it is usually to get them up to speed with new tech. In the past I have introduced them to TDD, BDD, DDD, continuous integration and dynamic cloud provisioning, just to name a few. They even sent me out to Italy once for a few days to evaluate the software architecture of an app they were considering to buy. I am eager to find out what it will be this time....
- A lot of people in my personal and social network are reaching out and handing me work/opportunities; some on the short term, some on the long term, and some even permanent. They help me, and I can help them as well, so it's a great feeling. I still have quite some leads up and running, and all thanks to you...
