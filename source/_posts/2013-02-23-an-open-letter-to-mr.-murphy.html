<p>Dear Mr. Murphy,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Pssssssssssssssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhtt !!!!</em></strong></p>
<p>... That was exactly the sound I was hearing when I got up early this Saturday morning (6.30AM'ish).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last months I have been billing on average about 9 to 10 hours per day for my customer, and those hours do not include my 30 to 60 minute lunchbreaks and my 3 to 5 hours spent on commuting when I decide not to sleep over, so you can imagine my time for doing things on the side is rather scarse at this moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the weekends, I am usually at one/both of my son's soccer matches, or getting back on track with my family and some friends, which I do not see during the week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have 2 books to finish and review/write a blog post about it, and have not been able to do this just yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today is Saturday, and I need to be at my parent's by 8.00AM where we meetup to disassemble, transport and temporarily store my brother's new kitchen they will use after their renovation. This will probably take the whole day, so I decided to get up at 6.30AM, because I wanted to answer some mails today. (Knowing myself, I will probably not be any the mood for this tonight anyway, as we will probably have a night out with the "kitchen disassembling crew".)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I got up at 6.30AM, ready to get started on these mails, as I heard a slightly disturbing sound... "PSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHT"; a continuous hiss.</p>
<p>As we do not have any gas plumbing in the house, I was not exactly afraid of explosions, but it was slightly disturbing nevertheless, so I went searching for the source of the sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I arrived in the cellar - all in my nightwear, for people with a lot of imagination -, I noticed our pression vessel from our rain water pump contained a very small dot of rust where water was streaming out at high pressure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I opened up some faucets to release the pressure, and started mobbing away, as we also store our heating pellets in our cellar - luckily I did not put them directly at the floor, otherwise the first few bags would have been ruined as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, instead of answering my emails, I decided to get my priorities straight, and take the explicit time to thank you and send you my regards, Mr. Murphy, as you apparently also went the extra mile to surprise me with this great morning gift ....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tom</p>
<p>Your Humble Servant</p>
