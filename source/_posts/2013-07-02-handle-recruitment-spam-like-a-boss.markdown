As you all know, I am fed up with 
[recruiters playing keyword lottery](http://tojans.me/blog/2012/11/16/fallacies-of-the-tech-recruitment-process/)
, and [I did post how recruiters should act](http://tojans.me/blog/2013/05/30/how-to-hire-a-senior-developer/), 
but most of them still continue playing keyword lottery.
Sometimes being polite does not work anymore, so I decided to fight fire with fire.

As most of the recruitment spam is automated, I decided to send an auto-reply with 
my rate and a link to my resume, mark the message as read and auto-archive it.

I do not mind recruiters sending me interesting opportunities, but I am a little bit 
fed up with all those 'interesting opportunities' which align with my profile like a 
cat matches the profile of a coast guard.
