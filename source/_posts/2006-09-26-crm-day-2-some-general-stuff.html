<p>
I have had some other things to do today, but I did find the time to read up on some of my rather basic &amp; rusty knowledge (ASP.Net 2.0 / Atlas / ... )<br />
I am hoping to put together the base classes this evening.
</p>
<p>
As a simple data mapper I will use ORM.Net because :
</p>
<ul>
	<li>I am familiar with it </li>
	<li>It works rather quick &amp; correct for a data mapper </li>
	<li>It is open source, so it could easily be adapted </li>
	<li>It does the job for me </li>
	<li>It implements a very nice query system</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some disadvantages :
</p>
<ul>
	<li>.Net 1.1, not 2.0, so no generics/partial classes&nbsp;etc </li>
	<li>Not a real ORM, only data mapper, but since one can define a 1:1 relation,&nbsp;ORM should be quite easy to implement </li>
	<li>Currently only SQL Server is supported </li>
	<li>Not a really active userbase</li>
</ul>
<p>
I will keep you all posted about my progress tonight !!!
