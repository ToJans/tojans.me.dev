title: Trading the Elliot Wave - Silver 28/8/2012
---

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is my first attempt to read the current trend in Silver, using mostly Elliot waves, Fibonacci retracements and RSI/MACD divergence. Feel free to state your opinion on my interpretation, and be aware that I am a complete newbie concerning this subject.</p>

<h3>Silver Daily</h3>

<p>To me this looks like a bearish pattern which is about to turn bullish due to both MACD and RSI divergence; I assume we are currently in the 2nd wave of the bullish pattern. The two shortest dotted lines mark wave 1 and 3 of an impulsive wave; the longest line marks the complete wave...&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Silver Hourly</h3>

<p>This trend also looks like it is about to convert; maybe this is the end of the first wave ? Although there is some resistance at the 30.66 level from the daily, I am expecting it to even fall lower to 30.0ish (38.2ext)... In case it does break through 31.27, this means the first wave is not in yet (even though I expect it to be, since it looks more like a corrective then an impulsive pattern... The short dotted line points to a possible impulsive wave, but I expect the long one to be a longer-term wave 1.</p>

<h3>Silver 5 mins</h3>

<p>The marked wave looks like a bearish impulsive pattern to me, and the MACD seems to have convergence... so I presume the bullish trend is not yet complete.... The RSI might be a bit cumbersome, so I am not quite sure what to make of this....</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While I can not guarantee anything, I would expect the silver to drop to the 30 or 29.6 level and bounce back into a wave 3; this would be a sign to go long. However, if it falls below 29.20 level, I would have to re-evaluate my possibilities.</p>
<p>In case it is a long, the third wave should go at least to the 35.25 level...</p>
