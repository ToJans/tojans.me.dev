<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Over at a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&amp;gid=95341" target="_blank">private LinkedIn newsgroup for ENTP personality types</a>, somebody posted a link to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2012/01/02/the-seven-habits-of-spectacularly-unsuccessful-executives/" target="_blank">"The Seven Habits of Spectacularly unsuccessful Executives"</a>. This is a great article, but not a lot of help IMO, instead of telling what not to do, one might be reversing the reasoning, and try to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>I posted this blurb in a comment on the newsgroup, and I figured I might as well post it on the blog as well...</p>
<p>Here we go:</p>

<h3>The Seven Habits of Possibly Spectacularly Successful Executives</h3>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#1: Look and interpret the market, you do not control the market, but have to follow it and adapt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2: The project is not an extension of yourself; take some distance and try to be objective. Do not spam your personal peers...</p>
<p>#3: Learn all the time: observe, measure, adjust &amp; iterate&nbsp;</p>
<p>#4: Positive reviews are great, but it's the negative reviews that enable you to become better&nbsp;</p>
<p>#5: Image is important, but your business is even more important; do not spend all your time on PR, but ship instead&nbsp;</p>
<p>#6: Admit it when you are wrong&nbsp;</p>
<p>#7: What worked in the past might not work in the future&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Looking back at these rules it is obvious:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix" target="_blank"> the four marketing P's (Product, Price, Placement, Promotion)</a> have to iterate a lot faster. A product is no longer in a solid state, but in a coninuous process of improvement.</p>
<p>To some of you who know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Startup" target="_blank">the lean startup approach</a> these habits might sound obvious, but for others it might sound new: the idea is to market your product as soon as possible (even sometimes before you have an actual product), measure the customer's reaction, re-evaluate and iterate... The iteration process has to be very short and agile, so you work in small incremental steps (opposed to the usual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front" target="_blank">BDUF </a>approach)</p>
<p>I think this might be one of the biggest paradigm shifts of the century: the speed by which a product evolves...</p>
<p>If you are interested in the lean approach, I might suggest you to subscribe for the free online course <a href="http://www.launchpad-class.org/" target="_blank">"The Lean Launchpad"</a>&nbsp;that starts in februari over at Stanford University, I know I did.</p>
