title: ! 'Project #Startup10: You pay peanuts, you get the monkeys'

<p>Note: this is a post from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Project-Startup10-Learning-to-build-your-own-business.aspx">a blog post series about starting up 10 businesses in a year</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I love <a href="https://appharbor.com/" target="_blank">appharbour</a>, in fact, I have 8 apps running over there at this moment. A little while ago, appharbour <a href="http://blog.appharbor.com/2012/02/02/announcing-pricing" target="_blank">announced that they now have to start making some money</a>, so that they were going to charge for custom hostnames...<br />I got a little dissapointed, since custom hostnames are an artificial limit, they do not add a lot of overhead to the system AFAIK, so why the hell would they charge for something like that??? I even was thinking about migrating my app to <a href="https://github.com/mauricemach/zappa" target="_blank">NodeJS, CoffeeScript and Zappa</a> and switching to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku </a>so I could have a free hostname, I even<a href="http://notanotherone.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"> set up a poc to check the feasibility</a>....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>So I would have to pay 10&euro;/month/site , and I do not have any profit yet...</h3>
<p>And I want to build <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Project-Startup10-Learning-to-build-your-own-business.aspx" target="_blank">10 different sites this year</a>, so I would have to pay 100&euro;/month just for custom hostnames, that is 1.2K&euro;/year; for that price I can get a lot of hosting... So I posted them this message, and they replied that I could find other hosting for this price, but the service would be different...</p>
<p>I could use options like<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_forwarding" target="_blank"> web forwarding</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaking" target="_blank">cloaking</a>, but this looks highly unprofessional... Maybe there are other alternatives ???</p>
<p>I decided to let this issue rest for a few weeks and progressed with my first two startups (<a href="http://blommekes.be/" target="_blank">blommekes.be</a> and <a href="http://dampen.be/" target="_blank">dampen.be</a>), updating them about umphteen times/day using a simple "git push apphb"... I could push fearlessly as I could just as easily revert to the previous version by the click of a mouse button... That is exactly one of the reasons I love it; they offer such a fine infrastructure... I even setup a simple staging environment by adding another apphb instance and a git remote...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Then I started thinking even more...</h3>
<p></p>
<p>After messing up 35&euro; and a lot of hours for MF*** Alertpay (which I'll never ever use again for sure), I paid 300&euro; to activate an <a href="http://www.ogone.be/" target="_blank">Ogone</a> account. I now also pay a monthly fee of 65&euro; for their service... Next to this I pay 4% for all transactions over mastercard/amex/maestro credit cards... I ordered 100 cardboard boxes for blommekes.be at 2.36&euro; a piece... Why the hell was I making a fuss about 10&euro;/Month for a custom hostname....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Here's the thing....</h3>
<p>With my startups I would like to make money; the more the merrier... I assume the folks over at appharbour have the same goal. What was I making all this fuss about ? I presume I was expecting them to carry my investement on the web part, which is a bit unfair to be honest...</p>

<p>Their service is great, their product is great; for me, this service has been awesome... So I decided to put my money where my mouth is, and just pay the damn hostname forwarding... After all, what is 10 &euro;/month for their service; if I can not make 10&euro;/month profit for a website, I should probably shut it down anyway... Yes, I could do hosting for a cheaper amount, but that would mean I can not use all their infrastructure, and would probably have to manage the server myself etc...</p>
<p>As I was writing this article, I managed to fubar the <a href="http://blommekes.be" target="_blank">blommekes.be</a> instance, but <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/troethom/status/174877146613956608" target="_blank">they replied over twitter within a few minutes; great support !!</a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Free is great, but sometimes one has to realize that not all things can be free; everybody has to make a living, so it is quite natural people charge you for what they do..... Sometimes one has to step back and pay for the service... If every apphb member is a freeloader, their service would probably not last long. I now happily pay the 10&euro;/month per site, and hope others will do to, so their product will stay available as their service offers great value to me....</p>
<p>I would like to end with a favorite quote from one of my friends:</p>
