title: ! 'Base Data Comfort and LG Viewty (KU990) : I am a follower'

<p>
After having some&nbsp;bad experiences&nbsp;with my previous mobile provider -the biggest one on the Belgian market, you all know who- I decided to move over my mobile services to the same provider as my telephone and Internet : <a href="http://www.telenet.be">telenet;</a> they have the advantage that one does not need to pay any extra membership fees for mobile services ; the cost was on a pay-per-use basis. 
</p>
<p>
While the <a href="http://telenet.be/314/0/1/en/residential/mobile-telephony/telenet-mobile.html">telenet mobile service</a> was actually pretty good value-for-money (as far as I recall they are a reseller for <a href="http://www.mobistar.be">mobistar</a>), they had one big disadvantage : this was only a speech and texting service, and no mobile surfing at all. 
</p>
<p>
<img style="float: left; width: 260px; height: 204px" src="/blog/content/binary/lg-2dviewty.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="260" height="204" />Since I recently bought an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewty">LG Viewty (KU990) mobile</a>, and am an avid user and fan of it, I decided to look for a new provider that offered some kind of data service at an acceptable price, so I could use the phone at it&#39;s full potential (web surfing and email). 
</p>
<p>
For a while, it looked like this would be like finding a needle in a haystack; most of the services were either cheap but to limited (i.e. 10MB/month for 5/10 &euro;) or to expensive for my occasional usage (25/50&euro;/month). 
</p>
<p>
Luckily, while I was looking around, Base launched the perfect solution : <a href="http://www.base.be/BASE/en/Home/Private/BASE_Data_Services/BASE_Data/Tariffs/page.aspx/3184">Base Data Comfort.</a> 
</p>
<p>
With this service, they <strong>offer 200MB download and upload/month at </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Data_Rates_for_GSM_Evolution"><strong>EDGE</strong></a><strong> speeds, at a single cost of 10&euro;/month.</strong> 
</p>
<p>
This is actually a first in Belgium, and is so new that even in the Base shop I&nbsp;registered, they never heard about it. Base does not seem to make a lot of noise about this, but I personally think this might be one of the key selling points to become a Base member; for me this was the key factor. 
</p>
<p>
At this moment I am really happy with this solution, but of course it is a little bit too early to&nbsp;build&nbsp;a final verdict. 
</p>
<p>
There are only two disadvantages right now :<br />
-&nbsp;Base does not offer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMTS">UMTS</a> or&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Speed_Downlink_Packet_Access">HSDPA</a>. However,&nbsp;browsing seems to work at an acceptable speed, and :<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the chance that HSDPA is available within my region is probably non-existent.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the difference between UMTS and EDGE is minimal as far as i can tell.<br />
- The&nbsp;other disadvantage at this moment was that I needed to sign a contract for at least 24 months.&nbsp;But, even if I might decide to break up my contract, the fee I will need to pay will be less than the one I needed to pay to <a href="http://www.proximus.be">Proximus</a>&nbsp;when I cancelled my contract.
