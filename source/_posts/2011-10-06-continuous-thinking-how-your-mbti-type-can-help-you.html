title: ! 'Continuous thinking: How your MBTI type can help you'
---

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I just finished commenting someone's opinion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator" target="_blank">the MBTI personality type</a>&nbsp;in a linkedin status update.</p>
<p>As you might have read in <a href="http://www.corebvba.be/blog/post/Continuous-thinking-Essay-The-secret-sauce-of-great-leadership-IMO-B)-.aspx">my previous post regarding "The secret sauce of great leadership - IMO ;)"</a> I am an avid fan of determining your own personality type in order to improve yourself.</p>
<p>Because this person had seen <a href="http://vimeo.com/20441760" target="_blank">a presentation by Patrick Vermeren on the myth of MBTI</a>, he <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/berkun/status/121332727134949376" target="_blank">retweeted the following</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; "><em><strong>I wish there was a test to take to find out how much you hate Meyers-Briggs (MBTI). I'd score off the charts.</strong></em></p>
<p>Since I most certainly do not agree, I commented some things on the linkedin thread. As I think the comment might have some value for my blog readers as well, I decided to post it here as well:</p>

<h3>Here is my opinion</h3>
<p>I believe your personality can change during puberty, but afterwards it is pretty much fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MBTI made me aware of my personality, and how to bridge to other types of personalities, by making the differences explicit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the test might not be spot on for some (f.e. my sister), it was spot on for me; the description matched me in both positive and negative ways. Since then I have learned to accept my personality, and being aware of your shortcomings and strengths helps you to improve yourself (i.e. self-awareness is key here). Once you master handling yourself, you can attempt to guess your discussion partner's MBTI type, which is quite obvious for the first letters,&nbsp;&nbsp;but harder for the next:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Introvert or Extravert ? (easy)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Sensing or iNtuitive (i.e. perception by facts or intuition)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Feeling or Thinking (i.e. emotion vs ratio)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Judging or Percepting (i.e. judge and get done with it vs constantly looking for alternative options/possibilities)&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you realize the type of your conversation partner, you should know how to talk to him/her...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While the MBTI test is certainly not a solution to everything, it can increase your self-awareness, and in the next phase also the awareness on how to interact with your discussion partner. You could compare this to level 3 and level 4 thinking in poker.</p>
<p>In my opinion anything that builds your self-awareness can be a good tool to expand your personal horizon.</p>
