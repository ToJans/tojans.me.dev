<p>
I&#39;m currently working on a new application for a plastic surgery clinic :&nbsp; <strong>&quot;Aestethics+&quot;</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;More news about this when the specs/prototype is finished. I twill be compliant with the international standards...<br />
A small screenshot of an early prototype (click to enlarge):

Also, in order to prevent forgetting appointements, tasks etc... I&#39;ve acquired myself a new device called a P910i. It&#39;s a hybrid GSM/PDA, but in a reasonable form factor. It certainly has improved my life a lot. Unlike any other smartphones/pda&#39;s, this one has 3 input methods : a touchscreen, a (very small) keyboard, and a virtual (=onscreen) keyboard.<br />

Syncronisation happens automagicly everythime I put the phone in the docking station, so I will not forget any appointements, mails, contacts or tasks..<br />
I am currently looking for opportunities using this phone, so more news might be on the way<br />
If you would like to have one too, please contact me...
