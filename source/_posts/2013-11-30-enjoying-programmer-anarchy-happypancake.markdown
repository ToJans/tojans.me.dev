## Introduction

About three months ago, I was looking for a new project after [a mini-retirement](http://tojans.me/blog/2013/03/30/freedom-learning-stuff-doing-consulting-aka-the-fun-and-money-balance/) where I spent most time with the kids and [on some OSS-work](http://tojans.me/blog/2013/06/25/why-i-contribute-to-oss-projects/) for [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).

When I posted this quest for a new project on [my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/tomjanssens), I got this reply:

> "I could totaly use you!" - [Tomas Roos](https://twitter.com/ptomasroos)

(Not sure whether that are the literal words, as I can't seem to go back in my LinkedIn activities - maybe Tomas could help me out here ;) )

*Some background: I know Tomas from twitter, and we had quite a few nights of long and interesting chats regarding software architecture and other stuff, so we kind of knew each other a bit...*

The project he wanted to start was all new and shiny to me: a rewrite of a very big dating site, moving it from the Microsoft stack to the Erlang stack... Anybody who has met me in the last year can probably imagine how thrilled I was [about doing Erlang](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40tojans%20erlang&src=typd) on a professional level.

Being completely new to the platform, we negotiated a doable rate, and closed the deal...

## Fast forward to 2 months later
We are now two months in the project, and here is a primer of the most interesting aspects of the project up until now...

## What a joy - Swedish Culture

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/80497449@N04/7378125668/" title="Sweden Grunge Flag by Free Grunge Textures - www.freestock.ca, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8145/7378125668_f90fa28057_n.jpg" width="320" height="200" alt="Sweden Grunge Flag"></a>

Swedish culture is really keen on getting your priorities straight, and spending enough time with your family is considered a basic need.

>Next to this, all is driven by trust, consensus-driven opinion making, and a *very* civilised way of discussing things. 

At first I assumed this to specific to my case, but after a few talks with one of my neighbours (who spends a lot of time in Sweden, as he works for Swedish car manufacturer thas has a big factory in Belgium), I started digging deeper into the subject; and apparently it is a culture thing.

If you are interested in this subject, I might suggest you to google a bit; [this](http://www.americaninsweden.com/ais/culture/nature.shtml) was one of the first hits I got that describes some aspects really good.

I have had a *very good* remoting experience on a project with someone from the US a few years ago, but somehow this feels different. So far so good!

Also, because us Belgians tend to be a bit less subtle in our communication, I suggested him that we agreed on a stop-word.

> Whenever I start loud-mouthing or try to make my point to much, Tomas says "Opera", and I know I have to take a step back...

While this might sound a bit ridiculous in the beginning, having a pre-defined short way to say "You're overdoing it", this allows us to be very honest about things without spending to much time on protocol. 

I don't think I ever needed to use "Opera", but as I am quite a big-mouth Tomas is probably glad we agreed on this protocol!

## Conclusion

This approach to work and life is quite new to me, but also very refreshing. I am looking forward to the next months in the project!
