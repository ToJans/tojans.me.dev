TL;DR: A C# List implementation respecting [the category theory Haskell usually uses](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Category_theory).

So, after implementing [the Maybe Monad in C#](http://tojans.me/blog/2014/06/16/functors-applicatives-and-monads-for-csharp-developers/) respecting category theory yesterday, I decided to implement the list as well, to gain a deeper understanding of it.

This is the result:

Enjoy!
